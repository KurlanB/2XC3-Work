Hi,

During this lab, I've learned about Linux file management, vim and shell scripting.

I am excited to learn about Git and GitHub to manage my projects and help me in the workplace.

I am worried about having to remember all the syntax and rules from all the languages learned.
It will not be easy for the tests and exams.
