	The & Operator and it's Side Effect

====================================================

I think it is an interesting feature in C that can be useful to manage variables.

Advantages:
- The & operator is very useful to modify variables when passed through a function, it allows for direct modificatino through the reference without needing to return and re-assign the variable again.

- It also helps save some memory space because there is no need to use extra local variables everytime a function is used. 

Disadvantages: 
- Pointers can become very confusing when using multiple functions and multiple files.

- Very easy to result in a lot of bugs and errors.
