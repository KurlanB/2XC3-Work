convert - Version 1.0.0

NAME
	convert - reads long integers from standard input and displays the numbers converted
	to a new radix(base).

USAGE
	Usage: convert [-b BASE] [-r START FINISH]
		1 < BASE < 37
		START and FINISH are long integers.

DESCRIPTION

	convert reads long integers in base 10 from standard input and converts them
	into a different radix. If [-b BASE] is used, then it changes the base to the given BASE, 
	else it converts to base 16. If [-r START FINISH] is entered, then displays converted
	numbers from starting value to finish value.

OPTIONS

Generic Program Information
	--help  Opens this page of usage and information.

Argument information
	-b  Accepts a BASE, which is the desired radix to convert to
	-r  Accepts a START and FINISH, instead or reading from standard input, 
	    converts the numbers from START to FINISH.

EXIT STATUS
	When program run successfully and end with EOF, exit status is 0, if error is run into, 
	exits with 1.

EXAMPLE
	The following example outputs the number of radix 16 'FF'.
	The standard input is 255, which represents the base 10 value.

	/$ convert
	   255
	   FF

	The following example outputs the number of radix 2 '10'.
	The argument '-b 2' represents the conversion to radix 2.
	The standard input is 2, which represents the base 10 value.

	/$ convert -b 2
	   2
	   10
	The following example outputs the number of radix 16 '-11 -10 -1 0 1 10 11'.
	The argument '-b 2' represents the base to be converted to.
	The argument '-r -3 3' represents the start and finishing numbers to convert.

	/$ convert -b 2 -r -3 3
	   -11
	   10
	   -1
	   0
	   1
	   10
	   11
