Exercise 2

a. The script outputs the current files in the directory that are not hidden. 
The script only takes the input at index 1, which is "ls" in our case and runs it.

b. I believe that the output of the sequence of commands will be "a 1 a1C 10". 
The final output was "a 1 a1C 1*10", this discrepancy occurs because the variables are initialized as Strings so arithmetic operations aren't performed.
