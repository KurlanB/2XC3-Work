Exercise 3
6.
	a) I think it is time efficient to remove the function calls, in the original primes program, 		 I received a runtime of 3.5845 seconds. After removing the function calls, it was a time of 	       3.4672 seconds which is significantly faster. If the program had to calculate a larger 
	   amount of numbers, this change would greatly affect the amount of time the program runs. 
	   For simple functions like quickcheck and checkfactor, it also improves the quality of the 
	   code, as there aren't as much lines to define a simple function. 

	b) I think that using parametrized macros is a lot better, because you don't have to type out 
	   the function definition again everywhere in the code. Macros work almost the same way as 
	   calling the function, except that they just replace the function name with it's definition,
	   instead of calling it, passing arguments and returning a value. 

Exercise 4

	c) Based on the evidence of the gprof report, changing the algorithm improved the runtime a
	   a lot more than removing the function calls. The runtime for the changed algorithm was
	   0.0273 seconds, which is almost a full 3 seconds faster than all the other programs. The
	   gprof also shows a 0% time usage for all functions and the checkfactor function was called
	   a lot less times.
	
	d) When the function cannot be optimized any further and the amount of times the function is
	   called cannot be changed, it would still be a good idea to remove function calls.
